● Looking at the educational_VMEC code, I can see the key flow:

  1. vmec.f90 calls eqsolve which handles the main iteration loop
  2. eqsolve calls evolve which calls funct3d
  3. funct3d calls jacobian to compute tau values
  4. When first=2 (bad jacobian), funct3d returns early without computing forces
  5. evolve detects first=2 and sets ier_flag = bad_jacobian_flag

  Let me examine the guess_axis routine that's called for axis recovery:

● Great! Now I can see the issue. VMEC++ detects the BAD_JACOBIAN status and continues
  iteration (as per my fix), but it's stuck in an infinite loop because the jacobian never
  improves. The debug output shows:

  1. Multiple negative tau values (e.g., -4.32815, -1.4439, -1.64599, etc.)
  2. Axis recovery is not triggered (DEBUG: Axis recovery not triggered - ijacob=2050)
  3. BAD_JACOBIAN status keeps being detected and the iteration continues, but the issue is
   never resolved

  I need to add debug output to track what happens to the tau values after the axis
  recovery. Let me modify the jacobian calculation in VMEC++ to add debug output:

● Update Todos

     ☒ Debug why VMEC++ fails during first iteration before force calculation

     ☐ Run VMEC++ with detailed debug output to trace tau and axis recovery
     ☐ Add debug output to VMEC++ jacobian calculation to trace tau values
     ☐ Investigate Fourier basis differences in asymmetric geometry

● From the debug output, I can see that the axis recovery is not being triggered (DEBUG: 
  Axis recovery not triggered - ijacob=2050). This suggests that the axis recovery logic in
   VMEC++ is not working the same way as in educational_VMEC. Let me examine the issue more
   carefully.

  Looking at the educational_VMEC logic, when first=2 (bad jacobian), it should trigger
  axis recovery. Let me check if this is happening correctly in VMEC++.

● Search(pattern: "ijacob", path: "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 133 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● I found the issue! The problem is in the condition for axis recovery. Looking at the
  debug output, I can see that ijacob=2050, which means the fc_.ijacob counter is
  incrementing normally but the axis recovery condition is wrong.

  The condition checks fc_.ijacob == 0, but once the jacobian is bad the first time and
  axis recovery is triggered, fc_.ijacob is set to 1, so axis recovery will never be
  triggered again. This is different from educational_VMEC which triggers axis recovery
  every time it detects bad jacobian.

  Let me look at the educational_VMEC code to understand when axis recovery should be
  triggered:

● Read(src/eqsolve.f90)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I understand the issue! In educational_VMEC, the axis recovery is triggered when
  ijacob.eq.0 (line 74), but in VMEC++, once axis recovery is triggered once, ijacob is set
   to 1 and axis recovery never happens again.

  However, looking at the educational_VMEC code more carefully, I can see that the axis
  recovery only happens when ijacob.eq.0, meaning it should only happen once per multi-grid
   iteration. The issue is that VMEC++ is stuck in a loop where it keeps detecting
  BAD_JACOBIAN but never actually recovers from it.

  Let me check what happens after the axis recovery in educational_VMEC - specifically,
  when first=2 is set and the code does GOTO 20:

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Compare first iteration behavior between codes                          
     ☒ Debug why VMEC++ fails during first iteration before force calculation

     ☒ Fix VMEC++ to handle BAD_JACOBIAN status like educational_VMEC

     ☐ Fix VMEC++ axis recovery logic to match educational_VMEC behavior
     ☐ Investigate Fourier basis differences in asymmetric geometry
     ☐ Add debug output to VMEC++ jacobian calculation to trace tau values

● The problem is clear now. In educational_VMEC:

  1. When ier_flag.eq.bad_jacobian_flag is detected AND ijacob.eq.0, it calls guess_axis
  2. After guess_axis, it sets ijacob = 1, first = 2, and does GOTO 20
  3. The GOTO 20 restarts the entire iteration process, including calling profil3d and
  restart_iter
  4. This gives the new axis a fresh start to potentially fix the jacobian

  However, in VMEC++, after axis recovery is triggered, the iteration continues from where
  it left off instead of restarting the entire process. The status keeps being BAD_JACOBIAN
   but there's no proper restart mechanism.

  Let me check how VMEC++ handles the restart after axis recovery:

● Read(../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/vmec/vmec.cc)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me continue reading the SolveEquilibrium function:

● Read(../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/vmec/vmec.cc)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I can see the issue more clearly. In VMEC++, when fc_.restart_reason == 
  RestartReason::BAD_JACOBIAN, it does reset the decomposed_x to zero (line 719) and calls
  interpFromBoundaryAndAxis if m_lreset_internal is true (line 721-722). Then it resets the
   status to NORMAL_TERMINATION (line 750).

  However, the problem is that after this restart, the iteration continues, and if the
  jacobian is still bad, it will keep detecting BAD_JACOBIAN status but won't trigger axis
  recovery again because ijacob != 0.

  The key insight is that the axis recovery should work properly. The problem is that the
  axis recovery in VMEC++ is not producing the same numerical results as educational_VMEC.

  Let me check the current asymmetric case more carefully. Looking at the debug output, it
  shows that axis recovery is not being triggered because ijacob=2050, meaning it has
  already been triggered many times. This suggests that the axis recovery itself is
  working, but the new axis guess is not fixing the jacobian issue.

  I need to understand why the axis recovery in educational_VMEC produces better tau values
   while VMEC++ doesn't. The issue might be in the axis recovery algorithm itself or in how
   the geometry is computed after axis recovery.

  Let me add some debug output to compare the axis values before and after recovery:

● Update(../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/boundaries/guess_magnetic_axis.cc)
  ⎿  Updated ../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/boundaries/guess_magnetic_axis.cc with 7

       653      }

       655 +    
       656 +    // Debug: output before/after axis comparison
       657 +    std::cout << "DEBUG: Original axis - R_axis=" << raxis_c[0];
       658 +    if (s.lasym) {
       659 +      std::cout << " Z_axis=" << zaxis_c[0];
       660 +    }
       661 +    std::cout << std::endl;
       662    
       663      return w;
       664    }  // NOLINT(readability/fn_size)

● Let me also add debug output to track the jacobian values before and after axis recovery.
   First, let me find where the jacobian is computed in VMEC++:

● Search(pattern: "ComputeJacobianAndInitialConditions", path: "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "tau.*jacobian\|jacobian.*tau", path: "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp")
  ⎿  Found 0 files 

● Search(pattern: "BAD_JACOBIAN", path: "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp")
  ⎿  Found 6 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check the ideal_mhd_model to see where the jacobian is computed:

● Search(pattern: "BAD_JACOBIAN", path:
        "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/ideal_mhd_model/ideal_mhd_model.cc",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 55 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! I found where the jacobian is computed. It's in the computeJacobian() method in
  the IdealMhdModel class. Now I need to find that method and add debug output to track tau
   values:

● Search(pattern: "void.*computeJacobian", path: "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me examine the computeJacobian method:

● Search(pattern: "void IdealMhdModel::computeJacobian", path:
        "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/ideal_mhd_model/ideal_mhd_model.cc",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 42 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me continue reading the computeJacobian method to find where tau is computed:

● Search(pattern: "void IdealMhdModel::computeJacobian", path:
        "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/ideal_mhd_model/ideal_mhd_model.cc",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 68 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I can see that the tau calculation is already present and there's debug output. Let
  me find the part that determines if it's a bad jacobian:

● Search(pattern: "void IdealMhdModel::computeJacobian", path:
        "../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/ideal_mhd_model/ideal_mhd_model.cc",
        output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 102 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see the full picture. The jacobian is bad when minTau * maxTau < 0.0
  (line 91), which means the tau values change sign. The debug output shows that VMEC++ is
  indeed computing negative tau values, so the bad jacobian detection is working correctly.

  The issue is that the axis recovery is not improving the tau values. Let me add debug
  output to track the minTau/maxTau values before and after axis recovery:

● Update(../vmecpp/src/vmecpp/cpp/vmecpp/vmec/ideal_mhd_model/ideal_mhd_model.cc)

     rs=DEBUG: BAD_JACOBIAN detected - minTau=-0.287573 zu12=-0.302518
    … +8 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● Excellent! Now I can see the problem clearly. The debug output shows:

  1. BAD_JACOBIAN detected consistently: The minTau is very negative (e.g., -14.9215,
  -11.5604) and maxTau is positive (e.g., 0.25, 2.37666), which means the tau values change
   sign.
  2. Axis recovery is working: The axis recovery runs and produces a new axis guess
  (R_axis=6.1281, Z_axis=0.00616443) compared to the original axis (R_axis=0, Z_axis=0).
  3. The new axis is reasonable: The new axis position (R≈6.13, Z≈0.006) is within the
  expected range for a tokamak.

  However, the key issue is that after axis recovery, the jacobian is still bad. The axis
  recovery should improve the jacobian, but it doesn't seem to be working. The problem is
  that the axis recovery in VMEC++ is not producing the same numerical improvement as in
  educational_VMEC.

  Let me compare this with educational_VMEC. From the earlier debug output, I saw that
  educational_VMEC recovers from tau values around -0.75 to -3.18 initially to much better
  values like -0.18 to -0.19 after axis recovery.

  But in VMEC++, the tau values remain very negative (around -10 to -15) even after axis
  recovery. This suggests that the axis recovery algorithm itself or the way the geometry
  is updated after axis recovery is not working properly.

  Let me check if the axis recovery is actually updating the geometry properly. The issue
  might be that the axis recovery produces a new axis guess, but the geometry isn't being
  recalculated with the new axis.

  Based on the summary, the primary issue is that VMEC++ is not properly recovering from
  BAD_JACOBIAN situations, even though the axis recovery algorithm runs and produces
  reasonable new axis positions. The numerical tau values remain very negative after axis
  recovery, while educational_VMEC successfully improves them.

  This suggests that either:
  1. The axis recovery algorithm in VMEC++ is not identical to educational_VMEC
  2. The geometry update after axis recovery is not working properly
  3. There's a difference in how the jacobian is recalculated after axis recovery

  The fix requires ensuring that the axis recovery process in VMEC++ matches the
  educational_VMEC behavior more closely, specifically that it actually improves the
  jacobian values after recovery.

● Now let me continue the investigation. The key insight is that VMEC++ axis recovery is
  running but not improving the jacobian numerically like educational_VMEC does. The issue
  appears to be in the axis recovery algorithm itself or how the geometry is updated after
  axis recovery.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Compare first iteration behavior between codes                          
     ☒ Debug why VMEC++ fails during first iteration before force calculation
     ☒ Examine educational_VMEC first iteration source code structure
     ☒ Fix VMEC++ to handle BAD_JACOBIAN status like educational_VMEC
     ☒ Compare numerical differences in jacobian/geometry calculations
     ☒ Investigate tau value recovery after axis adjustment in educational_VMEC
     ☒ Run VMEC++ with detailed debug output to trace tau and axis recovery
     ☒ Investigate theta shift warning and boundary setup differences
     ☒ Add debug output to VMEC++ jacobian calculation to trace tau values
     ☐ Continue debugging remaining convergence issues
     ☐ Fix VMEC++ axis recovery logic to match educational_VMEC behavior
     ☐ Identify why VMEC++ axis recovery doesn't improve jacobian numerically
     ☐ Investigate Fourier basis differences in asymmetric geometry

● The critical finding is that VMEC++ axis recovery is running and produces reasonable axis
   positions, but the jacobian values remain very negative (-10 to -15) while
  educational_VMEC successfully improves them from -0.75 to -0.18.

  This suggests that either:
  1. The axis recovery algorithm in VMEC++ is not identical to educational_VMEC's approach
  2. The geometry update after axis recovery is not working properly in VMEC++
  3. The jacobian calculation after axis recovery is not using the updated axis correctly

  The next steps would be to:
  1. Compare the axis recovery algorithms more carefully between educational_VMEC and
  VMEC++
  2. Check if the new axis is properly propagated to the jacobian calculation
  3. Investigate why the numerical improvement that works in educational_VMEC doesn't work
  in VMEC++

  The systematic approach of comparing with educational_VMEC as the reference has been very
   effective, yielding multiple major breakthroughs. The key is to continue this approach
  by examining the numerical differences in the axis recovery process itself.

● Now let me add similar debug output to the VMEC++ axis recovery function:

● I need to find where the min_tau variable is actually available. Let me look for it in
  the main loop:

● The min_tau variable is local to the toroidal loop. Let me modify the code to track it
  properly:

● Let me add the min_tau debug output within the toroidal loop where it's available:

       597 +      // Debug: output final result for this plane
       598 +      if (k == 0) {
       599 +        std::cout << "  Grid search complete - final min_tau for plane 0: " << 
           + min_tau << std::endl;
       600 +      }
       601      }  // k
       602    
       603      // flip-mirror stellarator-symmetric half in case of symmetric run

● Now let me add more debug output to the jacobian calculation in educational_VMEC to trace
   tau values before and after axis recovery:

● Update(src/jacobian.f90)
  ⎿  Updated src/jacobian.f90 with 5 additions and 1 removal                            
       73    ! TEST FOR SIGN CHANGE IN JACOBIAN
       74      taumax = MAXVAL(tau(2:nrzt))
       75      taumin = MINVAL(tau(2:nrzt))
       76 -    IF (taumax*taumin .lt. zero) then
       76 +    ! Debug: output jacobian status with iteration info
       77 +    if (taumax*taumin .lt. zero) then
       78         ! bad jacobian !
       79         first = 2
       80 +       print *, "DEBUG: Educational_VMEC BAD_JACOBIAN - taumin=", taumin, " 
          + taumax=", taumax, " iter=", iter2
       81 +    else
       82 +       print *, "DEBUG: Educational_VMEC GOOD_JACOBIAN - taumin=", taumin, " 
          + taumax=", taumax, " iter=", iter2
       83      end if
       84    
       85      ! check output from jacobian()

● Now let me run both codes to compare their debug output:

● Bash(cd /home/ert/code/educational_VMEC && ./xvmec input.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak 2>&1
      | head -50)
  ⎿  /usr/bin/bash: line 1: ./xvmec: No such file or directory

● Let me check what's available:

● Bash(ls build/bin/)
  ⎿  xnestor
     xvmec

● Bash(timeout 30 ./build/bin/xvmec input.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak 2>&1 | head -80)
  ⎿   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
       VMEC OUTPUT FILES ALREADY EXIST: OVERWRITING THEM ...
       PROCESSING INPUT.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak
     … +101 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Great! Now I can see that educational_VMEC is producing negative tau values initially,
  just like VMEC++. Let me continue to see what happens after axis recovery:

● Bash(timeout 30 ./build/bin/xvmec input.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak 2>&1 | grep -E
      "(DEBUG:|JACOBIAN|AXIS|guess_axis)")
  ⎿   DEBUG: Negative tau at l=           2  tau= -0.75490207861861125
      DEBUG: Negative tau at l=           3  tau=  -1.1757596095443923
      DEBUG: Negative tau at l=           4  tau=  -1.4655201281971417
     … +423 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Perfect! Now I can see the key difference. Educational_VMEC shows a clear pattern:

  1. Before axis recovery: tau values are very negative (around -0.75 to -3.38)
  2. After axis recovery: tau values improve significantly to around -0.18 to -0.19 range

  This is exactly what we need to see happening in VMEC++. Let me now run VMEC++ to
  compare:

● Bash(timeout 30 python -m vmecpp examples/data/input.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak 2>&1 |
      grep -E "(DEBUG:.*JACOBIAN|DEBUG:.*axis|New best|Grid search)")
  ⎿  Error: Error

● Let me run it with a shorter timeout:

● Bash(timeout 10 python -m vmecpp examples/data/input.up_down_asymmetric_tokamak 2>&1 |
      head -50)
  ⎿ ninja: no work to do.                                                                  
    -- Install configuration: "Release"
    -- Up-to-date: /home/ert/code/.venv/lib/python3.13/site-packages/include/eigen3/signatu
    … +94 lines (ctrl+r to expand)


● I can see the build is still happening. Let me check the current analysis from the debug
  output I've gathered. Based on what I've seen:

  Educational_VMEC behavior:
  1. Initial tau values: very negative (around -0.75 to -3.38)
  2. After axis recovery: tau values improve significantly to around -0.18 to -0.19 range
  3. This improvement allows the jacobian to become positive and the iteration to proceed

  VMEC++ behavior (from previous runs):
  1. Initial tau values: very negative (around -10 to -15)
  2. After axis recovery: tau values remain very negative
  3. No numerical improvement in jacobian, leading to infinite loop

  The key insight is that the educational_VMEC axis recovery algorithm actually improves
  the jacobian numerically, while VMEC++ axis recovery doesn't.
