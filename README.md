## Educational VMEC

This is a heavily stripped-down version of the serial implementation of VMEC 8.52.
It is forked from the `v251` branch of the [STELLOPT](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT) repository.

The goal of this project is to have a version of VMEC
which only computes the Stellarator MHD equilibrium and nothing more.

The `cmake` build system for stand-alone VMEC is borrowed
from [hiddenSymmetries/VMEC2000](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/VMEC2000)
and from [ORNL-Fusion/LIBSTELL](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/LIBSTELL).
