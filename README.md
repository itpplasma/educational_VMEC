## Educational VMEC

This is a heavily stripped-down version of the serial implementation of VMEC 8.52.
It is forked from the `v251` branch of the [STELLOPT](https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/STELLOPT) repository.

The goal of this project is to have a version of VMEC
which only computes the Stellarator MHD equilibrium and nothing more.
